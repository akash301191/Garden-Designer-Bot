# Garden Designer Bot

Garden Designer Bot is a smart Streamlit application that helps you create a personalized garden blueprint based on your backyard photo and gardening preferences. Powered by [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno), OpenAI's GPT-4o, and SerpAPI, this bot analyzes your garden image, identifies the landscape type, and generates a detailed markdown report with planting suggestions, layout ideas, and web-sourced inspiration links.
